# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# tim = Summoner.create(name: "thememan", riot_id: "20106984")
# cwn1 = Team.create(full_Id: "TEAM-f6ab8c00-452d-11e4-814b-782bcb4d1e24",
# name: "Can we not", tag: "CWN1")
# connect = Roster.create(summoner: tim, team: cwn1)
